Cities where I have lived for more than 2 years: 

Bangalore ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³\
Delhi + Gurgaon ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³\
Mumbai ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³\
Hyderabad ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³\
Kolkata ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³\
Colombo ğŸ‡±ğŸ‡°\
Singapore ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡¬\
Urbana-Champaign ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸\
Johannesburg ğŸ‡¿ğŸ‡¦\
Chicago ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸\
London ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§\

People often ask me which of these cities is my favourite. I think that is as difficult as asking who's your favourite person in the world. Some people might have a definite answer, but not me :)

Cities, like people, are constantly evolving. I too, as an individual, am constantly evolving. A city which I like today might not be a city I like in the future. Further, a city that liked me at a certain point in time might not like me back in the future.

So as of today, the world's my oyster!
